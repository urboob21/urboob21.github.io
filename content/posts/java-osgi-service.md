## 1. Introduction
- **OSGi Services** are essentially Java objects that provide a specific functionality or interface, and other components,plugins can dynamically discover and use these services.
- Multiple plugins can provide a service implementation for the service interface. Plugins can access the service implementation via the service interface.
- **E.g.** When you want to create modular that can be added or removed at runtime, you can use the OSGi service.

- `Bundle A` prove/publish a service implementation `S`.
- `Bundle B` can consume it by finding the service and binding to it when it is found.
- There can be multile `service implementation` (Bundle A', A''') published at the same time for the same type `S`.
- Services in OSGi are dynamic and can come and go at runtime.
- `OSGi Service Registry` is a controller.

- `OSGI` vs `Equinox Extension Point`:
  - `OSGi` is **many-to-many** relationship (multiple bundles can provide <-> multiple bundles can consume). 
  - `Equinox Extension Point` is **one-to-many** relationship (actually we can workaround accessing via `ExtensionRegistry`).
  - `OSGi Services` are retried by `type` -> safe
  - `Equinox Extension Point` access via `ID`

> With OSGi Declarative Services it is not necessary to register or consume services programmatically. This needs to be done with plain OSGi services where a service is typically registered (publish) to the ServiceRegistry in an Activator and consumed (find-bind) via ServiceTracker (also mostly via Activator). Instead of this a Service Component is declared via Component Description when using declarative services. The Component Description is an XML file that is processed by a Service Component Runtime (SCR, e.g. Felix SCR) when a bundle is activated. It is responsible for managing the components and their life cycle. That means, if you want to use declarative services in your application, you need to ensure that a Service Component Runtime bundle is installed and activated in your environment.

### 1.1. Components
- `Service Component`: A Java class that is declared via Component Description - not every component provides a service (e.g. in `DoingSomethingService.java`  - @Component(service = IDoingSomethingService.class))
- `Component Description`: The declaration of a `Service Component`, contained in the XML file (OSGI-INF/myservice.xml)
- `Component Properties`: A set of properties, specific by the `Component Description`
- `Component Property Type`: User define annotation type to define the Component Properties
- `Component Configuration`: 
- `Component Instance`:


- e.g:
- MANIFEST.MF
```xml
Service-Component: OSGI-INF/componentDescription.xml,
```
- Java:
```java
@ComponentPropertyType
public @interface MyComponentProperties{
    String value();
    boolean isOk();
}
public interface IMyService{
    void doSomething();
}

@Component(service = IMyService.class)
@MyComponentProperties(value = "1", isOke = true)
public class MyService implements IMyService{
    @Override
    void doSomething(){
        // do something here
    }
}
```
- XML automatically generate for OSGi Declare Service

### 1.2. Declaring a Component
- A component requires the following artifacts in the bundle:
  - An XML document that contains the component description.
  - The Service-Component manifest header which names the XML documents that contain the component descriptions.
  - An implementation class that is specified in the component description.

### 1.2.1 Immediate Component
- An immediate component **is activated as soon as its dependencies are satisfied**.
- `/OSGI-INF/activator.xml`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<scr:component name="example.activator"
    xmlns:scr="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.4.0">
    <implementation class="com.acme.impl.Activator"/>
</scr:component>
```
- The manifest header `Service-Component` must also be specified in the bundle manifest (MANIFEST.MF)
```xml
Service-Component: OSGI-INF/activator.xml
```
- Java class for this component
```java
public class Activator {
    protected
    public Activator() {...}

    @Activate
    private void activate(BundleContext context) {...}
    private void deactivate() {...}  
}
```
> The activate method is called when SCR activates the component configuration and the deactivate method is called when SCR deactivates the component configuration. If the activate method throws an Exception, then the component configuration is not activated and will be discarded.

### 1.2.2 Delayed Component
- Normally, it specifies a service
- If its configuration is satisfied, SRC must register the component in the service registry.
- When it is requested via `Service Caller`, it will be activated.
- `/OSGI-INF/handle.xml`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<scr:component name="example.handler"
    xmlns:scr="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.4.0">
    <implementation class="com.acme.impl.HandlerImpl"/>
    <property name="event.topics">some/topic</property>
    <service> 
        <provide interface="org.osgi.service.event.EventHandler"/> 
    </service>
</scr:component>
```
- Java class declare:
```java
public class HandlerImpl implements EventHandler{
    public void handleEvent(Event evt ) {
        ...
  }
}
```

## 2. Using OSGi
- There are several ways of defining, providing and consuming service.
- Let's start with create the API project to provide the external APIs for other components.
  
### 2.1. Create API project

### 2.2. Specific the API
- Create an interface for the service definition.

```java
package com.test.internal;

/**
 * Service for doing something
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
 */
public interface IDoingSomethingService {
	public void doSomething();
}

```
- Create the service implementation that implements service interface.
```java
@Component(service = { DoingSomethingService.class, IDoingSomethingService.class }, immediate = false)
public class DoingSomethingService implements IDoingSomethingService{

    @Override
    public void doSomething(){
        syserr("DoingSomethingService did something");
    }

}

```


- Testing: [ServiceCaller](https://help.eclipse.org/latest/nftopic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/ServiceCaller.html)
```java
 ServiceCaller.callOnce(MyClass.class, IDoingSomethingService.class, (myService) -> myService.doSomething());

```

## 3 DS Annotations
### 3.1. @Component
- It i to identify the class as a Service Component and is used to generate the Component Description.
- **Default**:
>    Its name is the full qualified class name
    It registers all of the class’s directly implemented interfaces as services
    The instance will be shared by all bundles
    It is enabled
    It is immediate if it has no services, otherwise it is delayed
    It has an optional configuration policy
    The configuration PID is the full qualified class name

- The defaults can be changed via **annotation type elements**:
  - `service`	: The name(s) of the interface or class this component is registered under as a service. Needs to be a full qualified class name.
  - `immediate`:	Control whether a component configuration should be immediately activated after becoming satisfied or if the activation should be delayed. Needs to be false in case the factory attribute is set also, needs to be true if no service is provided.
  - ...

### 3.2. @Activate, @Deactivate, @Modified
- Used to specify methods that should be called when a life cycle event happens.
  - `@Activate`:	The method that should be called on component activation.
  - `@Modified`:	The method that should be called if a configuration is updated using the ConfigurationAdmin.
  - `@Deactivate`:	The method that should be called on component deactivation.

- **e.g.**
```java
@Activate
private void activate() {

    //do some initialization stuff
}
```
 
### 3.3. @Reference
- Used to specify the dependency on other services.
- When the annotation is applied to a **method**, the method is the bind method of the reference.
- When the annotation is applied to a **field**, the field will contain the bound service(s) of the reference.

- Field Injection
```java
@Component
public class MyComponent {
    
    @Reference
    private MyService myService;

    public void doSomething() {
        myService.execute();
    }
}
 Khi MyService có trong OSGi Service Registry, nó sẽ tự động được inject vào myService.
 Nếu không có MyService, myService sẽ là null.
```

- Method Injection
```java
@Component
public class MyComponent {
    private MyService myService;

    @Reference
    protected void bindMyService(MyService myService) {
        this.myService = myService;
    }

    protected void unbindMyService(MyService myService) {
        if (this.myService == myService) {
            this.myService = null;
        }
    }
}
 Phương thức bind (bindMyService): Được gọi khi MyService có sẵn trong Service Registry.
 Phương thức unbind (unbindMyService): Được gọi khi service bị gỡ khỏi Registry.
❗ Đây là cách tốt để xử lý service lifecycle (khi service bị remove).
