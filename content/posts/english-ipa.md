## 1. American Intonation
> Note: 
> 1. Practice these sentences on your own.
> 2. Exaggerating the word that we think should be stressed.
> 3. Practice the sentences in random order ten times.
> 4. When we over-exaggerated, we will get tired or relaxed, we will stop paying attention. When this happens, like a rubber band, we're going to snap back to the way we originally were sounding (10 percent). So, if we just stretch ourself to the exact position where we ideally want to be, we'll go back almost completely to the old way when we relax.
> 5. Stretch ourself far beyond the normal range of intonation (150 percent), so when we relax, we relax back to a standard American sound (100 percent)
### 1.1. The American Speech Music
Americans tend to speak without moving their lips too much, focusing on sounds produced with the tongue in the throat.Like to Jazz.
- **Do not speak word by word.**
- **Connect words to form sound group.**
  -  Bob is on the phone  [bäbizän the foun]
- **Use staircase intonation.**
  - Word ending in an unvoiced consonant **-(t,k,s,x,f,sh)**, the preceding vowel is said quite quickly, and on **a single stair step**.
  - Word ending in a voiced consonant **-(b,d,g,z,zh,j)**, the preceding vowel is said more slowly, and on **a double stair step**.

- **Three ways to make intonation:**
  - Get louder or raise the volume
  - Streeeeeetch the word out or lengthen the word that we want to draw attention to.
  - **Change pith **(pausing just before 
changing the pitch)

- **Exercise 1:**
![image](/images/excercise_1.png)<br>

> Lấy một sợi dây cao su và giữ nó bằng hai ngón tay cái của bạn. Mỗi khi bạn muốn nhấn mạnh một từ bằng cách thay đổi cao độ, hãy kéo dây cao su. Kéo nó ra một cách nhẹ nhàng, đừng giật mạnh. Tạo một hình lặp ° ° với nó và làm tương tự với giọng nói của bạn. Sử dụng dây cao su và kéo căng nó ra mỗi khi bạn thay đổi cao độ. Đầu tiên đọc ngang, sau đó đọc xuống

### 1.2. Staircase Intonation
#### 1.2.1 Nouns
- Intonation or pitch change is primarily used to introduce new information. So, when we are making a statement for the first time, we will stress the **nouns**.
- **Exercise 2:**

#### 1.2.2 Pronouns
- Stress the verb as pronouns are old information.
```html
Dogs       bones
///// eat //////
They ///// them
////////////////
```
- **Exercise 3:**

#### 1.2.3 Question
- A question rises a little higher than a statement with the same intonation pattern.
```html
"Here is my car."
Here          ca
///// is     ///// ar 
///////// my ////////// 
///////////////////////

"Where is my car ?"
             car
             /////
Where        /////
///// is     ///// 
///////// my /////
//////////////////
```
#### 1.2.4 New Information/ Opinion/ Contrast/ "Can't"
- It sounds like **rain**.
- Duh-duh-duh **rain** | It sounds like **rain**.
```html
Duh                    ray
///// duh             ///// ayn.
///// ///// duh       ///// /////
///// ///// /////     ///// /////
```
- Make rain every musical and put it on two notes: ray-ayn.
----
- It sounds like **rain**. (It's rain)
- It **sounds** like rain. (It's not)
----
- He **likes** rain, but he **hates** snow.
- Like and hate are contrasted and are the stronger words.
----
- It **can't** rain when there're no **clouds**.
- Contractions (shouldn't, wouldn't) and negatives (no, not, never) are important words since they totally negate the meaning of a sentence, but they are not usually stressed. **Can't** is the exception.
