## 1. American Intonation
### 1.1. The American Speech Music
Americans tend to speak without moving their lips too much, focusing on sounds produced with the tongue in the throat.Like to Jazz.
- **Do not speak word by word.**
- **Connect words to form sound group.**
  -  Bob is on the phone  [bäbizän the foun]
- **Use staircase intonation.**
  - Word ending in an unvoiced consonant **-(t,k,s,x,f,sh)**, the preceding vowel is said quite quickly, and on **a single stair step**.
  - Word ending in a voiced consonant **-(b,d,g,z,zh,j)**, the preceding vowel is said more slowly, and on **a double stair step**.

- **Three ways to make intonation:**
  - Get louder or raise the volume
  - Streeeeeetch the word out or lengthen the word that we want to draw attention to.
  - **Change pith **(pausing just before 
changing the pitch)

### 1.2. Staircase Intonation
#### 1.2.1 Nouns
- Intonation or pitch change is primarily used to introduce new information. So, when we are making a statement for the first time, we will stress the **nouns**.

#### 1.2.2 Pronouns
- Stress the verb as pronouns are old information.
```html
Dogs       bones
///// eat //////
They ///// them
////////////////
```
#### 1.2.3 Question
- A question rises a little higher than a statement with the same intonation pattern.
```html
"Here is my car."
Here          ca
///// is     ///// ar 
///////// my ////////// 
///////////////////////

"Where is my car ?"
             car
             /////
Where        /////
///// is     ///// 
///////// my /////
//////////////////
```
#### 1.2.4 New Information/ Opinion/ Contrast/ "Can't"
- It sounds like **rain**.
- Duh-duh-duh **rain** | It sounds like **rain**.
```html
Duh                    ray
///// duh             ///// ayn.
///// ///// duh       ///// /////
///// ///// /////     ///// /////
```
- Make rain every musical and put it on two notes: ray-ayn.
----
- It sounds like **rain**. (It's rain)
- It **sounds** like rain. (It's not)
----
- He **likes** rain, but he **hates** snow.
- Like and hate are contrasted and are the stronger words.
----
- It **can't** rain when there're no **clouds**.
- Contractions (shouldn't, wouldn't) and negatives (no, not, never) are important words since they totally negate the meaning of a sentence, but they are not usually stressed. **Can't** is the exception.

----
It was pretty **good**. (She liked it.)
It was **pretty** good. (She didn't like it much.)

## 2. Intonation Patterns
*fall*
**rising**

### 2.1. Falling
- To talk about something which will definitely happen or that is complete:
  - I have to *work*.

- WH questions:
  - Why do you study *English* ?
## 2.2. Rising
- Yes/No question:
  - Did they **call**?

- Alternative questions: When you have `or` in a question, that's an alternative question.
  - Are they **coming** or *going* ?

## 2.3. Fall-rising
- Something is incomplete, we are uncertain of something or we still want to continue the sentence and it is not finished yet.
  - I don't play *ten***nis**, but I like watching it!

- We can have fall-rise intonation separately on 2 different words.
  - She is *quite* a good **teacher**, but she's a *bit old*.
